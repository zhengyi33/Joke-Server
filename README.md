# Joke-Server

In this repository are the server, client and administration applications for the joke server.

The joke server can toggle between joke mode and proverb mode by the administrator connecting to the server through the administration client. 

Randomized jokes and proverbs are served to multiple users on the client side who can switch between primary and secondary servers. 

The client conversations are maintained on interleaved servers with interleaved joke/proverb modes.
